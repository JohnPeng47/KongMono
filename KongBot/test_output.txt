Title:  William James and Functionalism 
Detailed description:  William James, an American philosopher and psychologist, played a crucial role in the development of psychology by introducing the functionalist perspective. James believed that psychology should focus on the functions and purposes of mental processes rather than just their structure. He emphasized the adaptive nature of human behavior and the importance of studying consciousness in relation to its practical value.
