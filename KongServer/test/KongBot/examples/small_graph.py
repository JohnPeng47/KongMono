The Constitution Act, 1867, establishes Canada as a federal parliamentary democracy, with a monarch as the head of state and an elected Parliament. It also outlines the division of legislative powers between the federal government and the provinces, ensuring that each level of government has specified areas of jurisdiction. The Constitution Act, 1982, introduced the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees fundamental freedoms, democratic rights, mobility rights, legal rights, and equality rights to all Canadians.
